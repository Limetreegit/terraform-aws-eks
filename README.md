# This is a private Terraform AWS EKS module I built

Prerequisit to push a module to Terraform model registry
1. code need to be in github, gitlab, bitbucket with public access
2. Github repository name convention:
terraform-<PROVIDER>-<MODULE_NAME>

3. Actually, just push the module code to Github is good enough for terraform run. Maybe it's no need to push it official Terraform registry
